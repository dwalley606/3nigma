## Description
I started this project as the first showcase of my new skills following the completetion of a full stack coding bootcamp. Beginning with the MERN stack, I decided I wanted to build a messging app that is universally compatible by running in the browser, was fully end-to-end encrypted, and could be used offline as a progressive web app.

## Installation
If you would like to install this project locally, feel free to clone the repository, install dependencies with npm install, and use npm run develop to simultaneously start the server and build the client. You must have a local mongodb installation to run locally.

## Usage
I'd like to eventually use this app to communicate with friends and family members who aren't tech savvy but want to stay in touch. Functioning like an "app" while being universally compatible allows those without technology experiencce to message with the best!
