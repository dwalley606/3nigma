# 3NIGMA

## Description
3NIGMA is a messaging application designed to be universally compatible by running in the browser. It is fully end-to-end encrypted and can be used offline as a progressive web app. This project is a showcase of my skills following the completion of a full-stack coding bootcamp, utilizing the MERN stack.

Please note, this is my first iteration of the app and I have not integrated encryption yet. Do not send private or sensitive information as it is visible in the db.
